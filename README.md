# Predict Credit Risk with Ensemble classifiers and Resampling

#### I have completed both Resampling and Ensemble Learning modules for the Classification Analysis to predict the credit risk.

### Ensemble Learning Findings

* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

  The Easy Ensemble Classifier model had the best score "Balanced Accuracy Score:0.931601605553446"

* Which model had the best recall score?

  The Easy Ensemble Classifier model had the best recall score : 0.94

* Which model had the best geometric mean score?

  The Easy Ensemble Classifier model had the best geometric mean score : 0.93

* What are the top three features?

  Top three features are,

  total_rec_prncp = 0.07876809003486353

  total_pymnt = 0.05883806887524815

  total_pymnt_inv = 0.05625613759225244

### Resampling Findings

* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

  Three models have the same best balanced accuracy score of 0.9934649587814939. These models are: Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, and SMOTEENN           Combination Sampling.

* Which model had the best recall score?

  The Recall score 0.99 was the avg/total recall score for all the models.

* Which model had the best geometric mean score?

  All models had the same score of 0.99 for the geometric mean.

  The performed models are: Simple Logistic Regression, Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Cluster Centroids Undersampling, and SMOTEENN Combination         Sampling.
